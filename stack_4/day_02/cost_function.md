A cost function is a mathematical equation that determines how well a supervised learning model fits a set of realizations. You can think of it as the 'distance' or 'difference' between what a model guess will happen and what actually happens. The use of a cost function is a part of supervised machine learning.

There are three broad classes of machine learning:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

[A summary of these topics is reviewed here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/common-machine-learning-algorithms/). However, the most important concept for this course is supervised learning. The reason a learning technique is 'supervised' is that you have collected historical data for both inputs to the model (features) and outcomes (response or predicted variable). You build a model using data from the past and then compare the performance to what actually happens in the future. The difference between these two things is the cost of the specific model. The goal of modeling in supervised learning is to find a model with the lowest cost (the smallest difference between what you predict and what actually happened).

This will make more sense as you work through the exercises. The following video gives an overview of the topic.

#### Note: Supervised vs Unsupervised ML
> **Supervised learning**: Models that can predict labels based on labeled training data
> - Classification: Models that predict labels as two or more discrete categories
> - Regression: Models that predict continuous labels

> **Unsupervised learning**: Models that identify structure in unlabeled data
> - Clustering: Models that detect and identify distinct groups in the data
> - Dimensionality reduction: Models that detect and identify lower-dimensional structure in higher-dimensional data

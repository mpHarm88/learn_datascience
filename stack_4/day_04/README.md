# Feature Engineering
The inputs to a machine learning model are often referred to as features. The process of evaluating and selecting inputs for the best performance is called feature engineering. This section will cover a number of commonly used techniques.

- Categorical Features
- Text Features
- Image Features
- Derived Features
- Imputation of Missing Data
- Feature Pipelines
